# Security Measures for IoT-Based Smart Healthcare Security

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This document outlines the **security measures** implemented in the IoT-based Smart Healthcare Security project to protect patient data and ensure system integrity.

## ðŸ”’ Security Measures

### **1. Data Encryption**
- **TLS Encryption (Transport Layer Security):**
  - All MQTT communications are encrypted using **TLS 1.2+**.
  - Ensures that patient data is protected from eavesdropping.
  - Default MQTT secure port: **8883**.

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):**
  - All transmitted data is encrypted at the source and decrypted only by authorized recipients.

### **2. Authentication & Access Control**
- **Username & Password Authentication:**
  - Every IoT device and cloud service must authenticate before publishing/subscribing to `healthcare/sensor_data`.

- **Token-Based Authentication:**
  - Each device uses a **secure API token** for authentication.
  - Tokens have expiration times and must be refreshed periodically.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Different roles with defined privileges:
    - **Doctors:** Access to assigned patient data.
    - **Patients:** Access to their own data.
    - **Administrators:** Manage user roles and security policies.

### **3. Secure Data Transmission**
- **MQTT Security Features:**
  - Use **QoS Level 2** for critical health data to ensure message delivery.
  - Enable **Last Will and Testament (LWT)** to detect device disconnection.
  - Restrict wildcard (`#`, `+`) subscriptions to prevent unauthorized monitoring.

- **Firewall & Network Security:**
  - Restrict open ports to essential services only.
  - Use **IP whitelisting** to allow only trusted sources.
  - Implement **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** to monitor traffic anomalies.

### **4. Data Integrity & Logging**
- **Message Integrity Validation:**
  - Implement **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)** to verify message authenticity.
  - Detects and prevents **man-in-the-middle attacks**.

- **Audit Logs & Monitoring:**
  - Maintain logs of all MQTT publish/subscribe actions.
  - Store logs in **secure cloud storage** with access control.
  - Regular log reviews for potential security threats.

### **5. Device Security**
- **Secure Boot & Firmware Updates:**
  - IoT devices must use **signed firmware updates**.
  - Ensure devices boot only with **verified firmware**.

- **Physical Security:**
  - Sensors and IoT devices must be placed in **secured environments**.
  - Prevent **unauthorized physical access**.

## âœ… Best Practices
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic **penetration testing**.
- **Data Minimization:** Transmit only **essential patient information**.
- **Backup & Recovery Plan:** Implement **automated data backups** to prevent loss.
